### ðŸŽ¨ custom guitar ideas ðŸªµ
- "***Libro***" the off-white manga panel guitar (manga panels painted in black onto the guitar, my favourite manga panels!)
- "***Atlas***" the light-blue-with-white-patterns guitar that has a world map on it, the point is that when i meet someone who's from that country, i get them to colour their country in and put their flag's sticker on it somewhere. just like those travel mugs with the maps on them!
- "***Eva***" the purple fender sonic esquire telecaster designed to have Unit-01 decals all over it, i haven't watched or consumed any Evangelion content, but the idea and content seems cool!
