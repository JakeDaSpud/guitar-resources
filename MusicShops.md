# Where to buy music... stuff
I am ☘️Irish☘️ and based in 🎻Ireland🍻, so most of my own sources and shops are either for the EU or Ireland / UK.\
I'll still try to source for other regions too!

## Shopping for Instruments

## Online Stores
[Amazon (🇩🇪German/Deutscher🇩🇪 Link)](https://www.amazon.de)\
Obviously you can get most brands for new and used on amazon, plenty of different sites for your region. (typically the Spanish site has more expensive tech than the German, while UK might have the cheapest stuff, but has plenty of customs charges because of Brexit :/)

[eBay](https://www.ebay.com)\
Yet again, most instruments in general can be gotten second hand on eBay!
