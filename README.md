## websites

### song / music learning sites üíø

[ultimate guitar](https://www.ultimate-guitar.com)\
tablatures (tabs) and chord charts, both user-made and official versions for songs. they have ukulele, guitar and piano/keyboard graphics for chords, as well as alternative ways of playing the chords. there's plenty of search options and tools, like transposing songs.

[chordify](https://chordify.net)\
sometimes when i don't find my song on ultimate guitar, i can find it here. the song is played alongside the chords, so you are shown exactly when the chords are played. there's also a feature where you give the site some chords, and it tells you what songs you can play with them!

### tablature (tab) making sites ‚úçÔ∏è
if you need to write down your guitar ideas so you can show them to others or yourself, use [tabs](https://www.schoolofrock.com/resources/guitar/reading-guitar-tabs-for-beginners)!\
(tabs are a quicker way to read guitar parts in the beginning, it's still advised to learn sheet music... eventually)

[guitar tab creator](https://www.guitartabcreator.com)\
this one i prefer the most, it's much easier for me to manipulate the tab in the "advanced" editor (personally i find the advanced one more intuitive lol).

[tab maker](https://tab-maker.com)\
this one is a newer one i found, i still prefer the other one for my own use, but this one shows you what each note on the fretboard is. this CAN be useful for learning what notes are where, and it changes with your tuning too!

### theory learning sites üìñ

[the notes in music](https://www.musicca.com/notes)\
in western music theory, we have 12 notes that we use.

[interactive circle of fifths](https://www.musicca.com/circle-of-fifths)\
the circle of fifths is a graph that shows the relationship between the major and minor keys in music, it's very handy for picking chords (if you can remember it!).

[the rest of musicca's notes...](https://www.musicca.com/lessons)\
they have a lot of notes, some good reading material ;).

### song making sites üéß
sites that aren't specifically guitar tabs, but more like website [DAW](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/what-is-a-daw)s

[online sequencer](https://onlinesequencer.net)\
i absolutely love this site, it's an online sequencer that you DON'T NEED AN ACCOUNT FOR! you can just save the link of your song and it stays up there! it has plenty of instruments and has guides for showing you what notes are in the key you want. it also has mix editing and lets you go from major > minor and vice versa.\
oh, and it has a whole community of incredible artists! (with a chat feature too!)

[soundtrap](https://www.soundtrap.com/musicmakers)\
this is spotify's DAW, i don't have much experience with it, but it has a lot of tutorials to show you around if you wanted something that felt more *"real"*.

### misc. tools üõ†Ô∏è

[tap bpm](https://www.beatsperminuteonline.com)\
ever wanted to know what beats per minute your song is in? or wanted to practice your rhythm while playing? it's a very important skill!

[chord identifier](https://www.all-guitar-chords.com/chords/identifier)\
you "draw" the chord that you're playing, and if it has a musical name, it will give you it! there are lots of other tools at the top of this site too.

[chord progression maker](https://www.musicca.com/chord-player)\
musicca back again ü§î, you can make chord progressions and generate them / tweak them to your liking, tempo and style!
